# Rhino-Dorkshop-2021
Hosted through The New School MFADT Dorkshops https://mfadt.parsons.edu/dorkshops/

*Rhino 3D is a powerful 3D modeling software used by multiple disciplines from jewelers to architects and back. Its ability to faithfully handle geometry makes it a great starting point for projects that involve prototyping, rendering, 3D printing, CNC machining, and more. Weâ€™ll be diving into the basics of Rhino in this Dorkshop and demonstrate one of its more popular plugins used for algorithmic modeling, Grasshopper 3D.

*Please have the 90 day trial of Rhino installed on your computer before the Workshop, and please also bring a mouse.
